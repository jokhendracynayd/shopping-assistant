# Shopping Assistant - Code Review & Improvement Plan

## 📋 Executive Summary

Your shopping assistant application is a well-architected, sophisticated system built with modern technologies. The codebase demonstrates good separation of concerns with a modular design supporting multiple LLM providers and vector databases. However, there are several areas where improvements can significantly enhance code quality, maintainability, and production readiness.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Current Architecture Strengths
- ✅ **Modular Design**: Clean separation between API, services, models, and utilities
- ✅ **Multiple LLM Support**: Unified interface for OpenAI, Groq, and Anthropic
- ✅ **Vector Store Flexibility**: Support for Weaviate, FAISS, ChromaDB, and PGVector
- ✅ **Graph-based Processing**: LangGraph integration for complex query processing
- ✅ **Structured Error Handling**: Centralized error management with custom error codes
- ✅ **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration with Pydantic
- ✅ **Logging Framework**: Structured JSON logging with file rotation

### Areas Requiring Attention
- ⚠️ **Placeholder Implementations**: Several service methods contain placeholder logic
- ⚠️ **Testing Coverage**: No visible test implementations
- ⚠️ **Documentation**: Limited API and code documentation
- ⚠️ **Production Readiness**: Missing monitoring, health checks, and deployment configs

  python_version = "3.13"
  warn_return_any = true
  ```
- [ ] Run `black`, `ruff`, and `mypy` on entire codebase
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for code quality
